# Spam Classification Project

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying text messages as "spam" or "ham" using various machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project contains labeled messages which are processed and analyzed to build a classification model. 

## Tools and Modules Used

### Programming Language
- **Python**: The core programming language used for development.

### Libraries and Modules

- **Numpy**: 
  - Used for numerical operations and handling arrays.
- **Pandas**: 
  - Used for data manipulation and analysis, including reading and cleaning the dataset.
- **Matplotlib**: 
  - Utilized for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: 
  - A data visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**:
  - Used for text processing and natural language processing tasks, such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
- **Scikit-Learn**:
  - Provides tools for model building, evaluation, and performance metrics. Includes:
    - **CountVectorizer**, **TfidfVectorizer**: For text feature extraction.
    - **train_test_split**: For splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
    - **MultinomialNB**, **BernoulliNB**, **GaussianNB**: Naive Bayes classifiers.
    - **SVC**, **KNeighborsClassifier**, **LogisticRegression**, **DecisionTreeClassifier**, **RandomForestClassifier**, **AdaBoostClassifier**, **BaggingClassifier**, **ExtraTreesClassifier**, **GradientBoostingClassifier**: Various classification algorithms.
    - **VotingClassifier**, **StackingClassifier**: For ensemble methods.
  - **accuracy_score**, **confusion_matrix**, **precision_score**: Metrics for evaluating model performance.
- **WordCloud**: 
  - Generates word clouds for visualizing text data.

### Data Processing
- **Excel File**: The dataset is read from an Excel file using Pandas.

## How to Run

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Ensure you have all the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
   ```sh
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn nltk scikit-learn wordcloud xgboost
   ```

2. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   Place your dataset file `spam.xlsx` in the appropriate directory or update the file path in the script.

3. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script using Python:
   ```sh
   python script_name.py
   ```

4. **Model Saving**:
   The final models and vectorizer are saved as `model.pkl` and `vectorizer.pkl` respectively for later use.
